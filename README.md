## JavaScript Take Notes!  
This is my second Utility based Web App! By taking inspiration from the Keep Notes App from Google, I designed and constructed from scratch this Notes App!  
You can write anything on the Note, it features text styling tools to help you write notes the way you want them to look like.  
### Features  
  - Notes can be **Dragged and Dropped** after you hold them for a certain amount of time.  
  - Notes can be **Dropped** to the **Side-Bar** to store them, this can be **Opened** and **Closed**.  
  - There is no **limit** for how many Notes are saved.  
  - The page will **Auto-Generate** a new Note.  
  - In order to **edit** a Note, it must be **placed** on the main page area.   
  - Notes can be **Deleted** when they are on edit mode.  
  - Notes can be **Added** when the main page area is **empty**.  
  - By **Highlighting** a text, you can use the **Text Styling Buttons** to:  
    - Align text to the **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**.  
    - Change the style of the text to **Bold**, **Underlined**, or **Italic**.  
    - Insert **Bullet Points**.  
    - And **Save** your notes.  
  - Save all data to **local storage**.  
  - Nice animations.  
This was made with only pure **vanilla JavaScript**.
